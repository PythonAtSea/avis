# Avis

Avis is a pretty simple clicker game, but with a slight twist. The button hatches Woodcocks, which then slowly get worms, which can be used to buy stuff. However, the Woodcocks will eventually die, so you have to hatch more of 'em! It's made using next, but NOT shadcn, that stuff get's boring I'm ngl.
